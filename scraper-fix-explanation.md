# Scraper Fix Explanation

## Problem

The error occurred because in `run_scraper.py`, the district_filter was being created as a list:

```python
district_filter = [district.strip() for district in args.districts.replace(',', ' ').split() if district.strip()]
```

But in `scraper.py`, the code was assuming it was a string and trying to call the string method `lower()` on it:

```python
if district_filter and district_filter.lower() != "all":
```

Similarly, room_filter was also being created as a list but processed as if it were a string.

## Solution

I made the following changes to fix the issues:

1. Added type checking for district_filter:
   ```python
   if district_filter:
       # Check if district_filter is already a list
       if isinstance(district_filter, list):
           if len(district_filter) == 1 and district_filter[0].lower() == "all":
               self.district_filter = None
           else:
               self.district_filter = district_filter
       # If it's a string
       elif district_filter.lower() != "all":
           # Handle comma or space separated list of districts
           districts = re.split(r'[,\s]+', district_filter)
           self.district_filter = [d.strip() for d in districts if d.strip()]
       else:
           self.district_filter = None
   ```

2. Added type checking for room_filter:
   ```python
   if room_filter:
       # Check if room_filter is already a list of integers
       if isinstance(room_filter, list):
           self.room_filter = room_filter
       else:
           # Handle room ranges like 1-3 or individual numbers like 2,3,4
           room_specs = room_filter.split(',')
           self.room_filter = []
           
           for spec in room_specs:
               if '-' in spec:
                   start, end = map(str.strip, spec.split('-'))
                   self.room_filter.extend(range(int(start), int(end) + 1))
               else:
                   self.room_filter.append(int(spec.strip()))
   ```

These changes make the scraper.py file work with both string and list inputs for district_filter and room_filter.

## No Need for Replacement

Instead of replacing the scraper with a new implementation, I directly fixed the issues in the existing scraper code. This approach maintains compatibility with existing code while fixing the specific bugs.
