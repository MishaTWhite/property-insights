# Scraper Code Status and Integration Plan

## Current Status

I've analyzed the codebase and found the following:

1. There are two scraper implementations:
   - `server/src/otodom_parser/scraper.py`: The original scraper
   - `server/src/otodom_parser/scraper_fixed.py`: A new, improved version of the scraper

2. The application is still using the original scraper. In `server/src/otodom_parser/run_scraper.py`, the code imports from the original scraper:
   ```python
   from otodom_parser.scraper import OtodomScraper
   ```

3. There is no code that imports or uses the new `scraper_fixed.py` implementation.

In summary: **The scraper code was not replaced**. Instead, a new implementation was created but not integrated into the application.

## Integration Plan

To properly integrate the new scraper implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Test the new scraper**: First, make sure the new implementation works as expected by running tests on it.

2. **Update imports**: Modify `run_scraper.py` to use the new implementation:
   ```python
   # Change this line:
   from otodom_parser.scraper import OtodomScraper
   # To:
   from otodom_parser.scraper_fixed import OtodomScraper
   ```

3. **Consider backward compatibility**: If there are any differences in the API between the old and new scrapers, ensure they are compatible or update any code that depends on the scraper.

4. **Option 1 - Replace the old file**: If you want to completely replace the old implementation:
   ```
   # Rename scraper_fixed.py to scraper.py, effectively replacing the original
   mv server/src/otodom_parser/scraper_fixed.py server/src/otodom_parser/scraper.py
   ```

5. **Option 2 - Keep both files**: If you want to keep both implementations available:
   ```
   # Just update the imports in run_scraper.py and other files to use scraper_fixed
   ```

6. **Testing after integration**: After making these changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure the new scraper works correctly in the production environment.

7. **Update documentation**: Make sure any documentation referring to the scraper is updated to reflect the new implementation.

## Recommendation

I recommend going with Option 1 (replacing the old file) if the new implementation is a direct improvement with no significant API changes. This keeps the codebase cleaner and prevents confusion about which scraper implementation to use.
