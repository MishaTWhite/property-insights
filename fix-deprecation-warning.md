# Fixing the util._extend Deprecation Warning

## Problem
The application is showing the following deprecation warning:
```
[DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The `util._extend` API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.
```

This warning is coming from `spawn-command.js:9`, which is a dependency used by the `concurrently` package (version 8.2.2) that we use to run both the server and client simultaneously.

## Solution
Let's update the concurrently package to the latest version (currently 8.2.2 in our package.json):

1. Update the root package.json to use the latest version of concurrently (if available):

```bash
npm install concurrently@latest --save-dev
```

If updating doesn't resolve the issue, we have a few alternative options:

1. **Use npm-run-all instead of concurrently**:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall concurrently
   npm install npm-run-all --save-dev
   ```
   
   Then update the start script in package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "npm-run-all --parallel server client",
     "server": "cd server && npm start",
     "client": "cd client && npm run dev"
   }
   ```

2. **Ignore the deprecation warning** since it doesn't affect functionality:
   Run the application with the `--no-deprecation` flag:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "concurrently \"cd server && node --no-deprecation src/index.js\" \"cd client && npm run dev\""
   }
   ```

3. **Create a custom script** to start both server and client without relying on concurrently.

The simplest approach is to try updating concurrently first, as this is a minor issue that likely has been addressed in newer versions of the dependency chain.
