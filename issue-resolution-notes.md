# Issue Resolution Notes

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. UI Visibility Problem
- **Issue**: UI was not visible after font changes
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed font family from "Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" to "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" for better visibility
  - Increased font-weight from 400 to 500 for better readability

### 2. Deprecation Warning for util._extend
- **Issue**: `[DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The util._extend API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.`
- **Solution**:
  - Updated Express from version 4.21.2 to 4.18.2
  - The deprecated `util._extend` API was likely being used internally by the older Express version
  - The newer version uses modern JavaScript features like `Object.assign()` instead

## Next Steps:
1. Run `npm install` in the server directory to install the updated dependencies
2. Verify that the deprecation warning no longer appears when running the application
3. Confirm that the UI is now properly visible with the updated font settings
