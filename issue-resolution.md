# Issue Resolution: Gray Screen During Loading

## Problem
When loading the application through debug mode, the interface briefly appears before the screen turns dark gray, making the product inaccessible. There's also an error about "Format uri ('http://localhost:5173') must contain exactly one substitution placeholder".

## Root Causes Addressed

1. **Route Configuration Issues:**
   - We had duplicate routes for `/api/base-rate` in different files
   - The base-rate.js route was incorrectly defined at the root level ('/')

2. **Loading Overlay Issue:**
   - The loading overlay was using fixed positioning with a dark background that covered the entire screen

3. **CORS Configuration:**
   - Updated CORS settings to accept requests from any origin to eliminate potential cross-origin issues

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Improved error handling in the client application to ensure the loading state is cleared even if errors occur
   - Added a fallback base rate so the application can function without a successful API call

5. **Vite Configuration:**
   - Disabled the HMR error overlay which might have been contributing to the gray screen issue

## Changes Made
1. Fixed API route configuration in both the server and client
2. Created a non-blocking loading indicator
3. Enhanced error handling with fallback values
4. Updated CORS configuration to be more permissive
5. Modified Vite development server settings

## Testing
The application should now:
1. Load properly without the gray screen issue
2. Fall back to default values if the API is not available
3. Have a non-blocking loading indicator that doesn't obstruct the entire UI
