# DataGrid Dependency Resolution Report

## Current Status
- **@mui/material** (v7.0.2) is already installed
- **@emotion/react** (v11.14.0) is already installed
- **@emotion/styled** (v11.14.0) is already installed
- **@mui/x-data-grid** (v8.2.0) was installed and has been removed

## DataGrid Component Usage
A thorough search of the codebase shows:
- No `<DataGrid>` components are being used
- No imports from '@mui/x-data-grid' are present
- No incorrect imports of DataGrid from '@mui/material' are present

## Resolution
According to the requirements and findings:
1. The mandatory Emotion peer-dependencies are already present
2. DataGrid components are not being used in the codebase
3. As instructed, since DataGrid is not used, I have removed the unused @mui/x-data-grid package dependency from package.json
